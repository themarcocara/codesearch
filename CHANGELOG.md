# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).



## [1.0.97] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **CLI auto-register retry race** — after auto-registering a new repo (POST
  `/repos` → 202 Accepted), the CLI no longer retries the reindex immediately.
  The previous retry raced with the background indexing task and always failed
  with "Database not found" because the LMDB database hadn't been created yet.
- **`cargo fmt` CI failures** — pinned toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` and
  updated local rustfmt (1.92 → 1.95) to match CI.



## [1.0.96] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **`add_repo_handler` deadlock** — POST `/repos` was calling `index_quiet()`
  inline, causing a deadlock when the serve's own startup (Phase 1) still held
  the LMDB lock. Indexing now runs in a `tokio::spawn` background task and the
  handler returns `202 Accepted` immediately, matching the `reindex_handler`
  pattern. This fixes the "fresh install → serve hangs" scenario on both Linux
  and Windows.



## [1.0.95] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **POST /reload endpoint** — forces `repos.json` reload from disk, even if
  the file mtime hasn't changed. Used by the TUI `[s]` key to pick up
  externally added/removed repos without restarting serve.
- **TUI `[s]` key** — both embedded and remote TUIs now support `[s]` to
  manually reload `repos.json`, picking up repos added via `codesearch index add`
  or other external changes.
- **CLI auto-register on 404** — `codesearch index -f` from a directory not
  yet in `repos.json` now auto-registers the repo with the running serve
  instance (via `POST /repos`) instead of falling back to local indexing,
  which caused LMDB file-lock conflicts.

### Changed

- **Removed vendor name references** from docs and comments for a cleaner
  public repository.



## [1.0.94] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **C# semantic analysis helper (`scip-csharp`)** — a small .NET 10 CLI tool
  that wraps Roslyn's `SymbolFinder.FindReferencesAsync()` and produces a
  symbol reference index. Framework-dependent, ~5–15 MB. Bundled in the new
  `-with-csharp` release variants, or available via `$PATH` / env var override.
- **`-with-csharp` release variants** — pre-built release archives that include
  the `scip-csharp` helper alongside the codesearch binary. There are now 6
  release archives total: 3 plain `codesearch` packages and 3
  `codesearch-with-csharp` packages (Windows, Linux, macOS). The plain
  packages are unchanged for users who don't need C# symbol references.
- **Dedicated C# README** — all C#-specific goal, operation, installation, and
  testing instructions now live in `README_CSharp.md`; the main README only
  links there so non-C# users can skip the extra detail.
- **`.cs` file watcher debounce** — 60-second quiet period after `.cs` file
  changes triggers an automatic symbol index rebuild. Buffer is cleared on git
  branch switches to avoid stale rebuilds.
- **`symbols=true` query parameter** on the serve reindex endpoint
  (`POST /repos/:alias/reindex?force=true&symbols=true`) for forced symbol
  index rebuilds.

### Changed

- **Architecture is language-agnostic**: the `SymbolIndexer` trait and
  per-language adapter pattern are in place. Future branches can add Python
  (scip-python), TypeScript (scip-typescript), Rust (scip-rust), etc. without
  redesigning.

### Breaking

- **LMDB format change** — existing `scip` LMDB databases require a
  full rebuild after this upgrade. The first `find_impact` call (or
  explicit `reindex?symbols=true`) will trigger an automatic rebuild.
  No manual data migration is needed.

### Fixed

- **`status(projects)` now returns real chunk counts** for unopened repos by
  persisting them in `metadata.json` after every indexing operation (B2).
- **Double chunks on reindex** — guard clears both stores when `FileMetaStore`
  is empty but `VectorStore` has data, preventing full duplication (B1).
- **Regex `\w+`/`\b`/`\d` broken in literal mode** — extracts clean BM25 tokens
  from regex patterns for candidate generation while preserving full regex for
  post-filter (B3).
- **Duplicate definitions in `find_impact`** — `FindCommonRoot` now uses all
  solution projects instead of filtered subset for consistent relative paths (B4).
- **`codesearch index` now always delegates to running serve** (not just `-f`),
  preventing LMDB file-lock conflicts between CLI and serve.
- **`release.ps1` path resolution** — fixed .NET `ReadAllText` resolving against
  wrong CWD by using absolute paths derived from script location.
- **JSON version validation** — `parse_json_index()` now rejects scip-csharp
  index versions other than `"1.0"`, preventing silent breakage when the
  helper is updated to an incompatible format.
- **Helper detection failure cache** — `detect_helper()` now caches
  "helper not found" results, eliminating repeated PATH lookups and
  subprocess probes on every MCP `find_impact` request when the helper
  is missing.
- **Bincode schema versioning** — all LMDB payloads now include a
  version byte. Reading data from a future schema version produces a
  clear error with rebuild instructions instead of silent corruption.
- **Shared `SymbolIndexerRegistry`** — `find_impact` (MCP) and
  `trigger_symbol_rebuild` (HTTP) now reuse the shared registry from
  `ServeState` instead of creating fresh instances per request,
  restoring cache effectiveness.
- **O(1) position lookup** — `find_references_by_position` now uses a
  secondary `scip_positions` LMDB table instead of iterating and
  deserializing every symbol in the database.
- **O(1) fuzzy lookup** — `find_references` fuzzy fallback now uses a
  secondary `scip_simple_names` LMDB table instead of a full-table
  scan with bincode deserialization.
- **Removed `#[allow(dead_code)]`** on 5 SCIP constants in
  `constants.rs` that are now actively referenced from `csharp.rs`.



## [1.0.93] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- **Local QC gate** (`scripts/qc.ps1`) — mirrors CI checks locally
  (`fmt → check → clippy → test --lib → test --test *`) and
  includes pre-push hook (`scripts/pre-push`) that blocks pushes when QC fails.
  Prevents recurring "local pass, CI fail" problems.
- **CodeQL configuration** — added `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` to suppress
  `rust/path-injection` false positives (codesearch is a local dev tool,
  not a web-facing server). In-repo CodeQL workflow configured to use this config.

### Fixed

- **`test_gitignore_rules_respected`** — gitignore directory patterns like `obj/`,
  `bin/`, `.claude/` now correctly match nested files. The `is_gitignored()`
  method iterates over all path components with `is_dir=true` so that
  directory-only patterns match files inside them.
- **Clippy `unnecessary_sort_by`** — replaced `sort_by()` with `sort_by_key()`
  in two locations in `src/serve/mod.rs` to avoid lint failure on CI.



## [1.0.81] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **`codesearch serve tui`** — standalone sub-action that opens the ratatui TUI
  connected to a running serve instance via HTTP polling. The TUI can be opened
  and closed independently of the server.
- **`codesearch serve --no-tui`** — start serve headless even when a TTY is
  available. Typical workflow: `codesearch serve --no-tui` in one terminal,
  `codesearch serve tui` in another.
- **`GET /status` endpoint** on serve returns a JSON snapshot of all repo
  states, sessions, and CPU usage — usable for external monitoring and the
  standalone TUI.

### Fixed

- **Idle eviction now covers warmed-but-never-queried repos**: `warmup_repo`
  starts the idle timer at warmup so background-warmed aliases (ExampleRepo,
  DPS, ExampleRepo and others showing `Last Tool Call = -` indefinitely) are
  evicted by the idle reaper instead of holding LMDB envs and embedder state
  forever.
- **Ctrl-C no longer quits the TUI**: crossterm's raw mode delivers Ctrl-C as
  a key event, bypassing the OS-level handler. Treating it as quit was a
  foot-gun: a stray Ctrl-C in the wrong terminal would tear down the whole
  serve. Use `q` only.

### Changed

- **`unsafe` blocks documented**: SAFETY comments added to the three LMDB
  env-open `unsafe` blocks in `src/embed/cache.rs` and `src/vectordb/store.rs`.



## [1.0.77] - 2026-05-01

### Removed

- Stale planning documents (`.docs/`) and old benchmark results (`benchmarks/`)
  removed from the repository. These were internal working documents with no
  value for contributors.



## [1.0.74] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **MCP session keep_alive timeout removed**: the previous 30-minute idle timeout
  was killing sessions mid-working-day. Sessions now live until TCP dies, which
  is the correct behaviour for a local single-user long-running serve process.



## [1.0.72] - 2026-05-01

First stable release of codesearch — a Rust-based hybrid (vector + BM25 + AST)
code search MCP server, optimised for AI coding agents working across many
repositories.

### Added

- **Multi-repository serve mode** (`codesearch serve`): a long-running HTTP/SSE
  process that holds many indexed repositories warm at the same time, with
  per-project routing via `project=…`, group routing via `group=…`, and
  cross-repository search using RRF fusion across project boundaries.
- **Stdio proxy with auto-reconnect**: `codesearch mcp` (stdio mode) detects a
  running `serve` process and proxies tool calls to it. The proxy now performs
  client-side retries with a forced reconnect when it sees a transport-level
  failure (broken TCP keep-alive, stale session 404, server restart, laptop
  suspend) so MCP clients like Claude Desktop self-heal transparently. After a
  serve restart the first call returns a clear "reconnecting" message and the
  next call succeeds.
- **MCP tool surface optimised for agents** to reduce grep-fallback behaviour:
  - `search` (semantic / hybrid / lexical / pure-literal regex modes)
  - `find` (definition / usages / imports / dependents)
  - `explore` (file outline / similar chunks)
  - `get_chunk` for cheap follow-up reads of a specific code chunk
  - `status` (index / projects)
- **Tree-sitter AST-aware chunking** for 9 languages: Rust, Python, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, C, C++, C#, Go, Java.
- **Persistent embedding cache** keyed on SHA-256 of chunk content, surviving
  `--force` rebuilds and per-file re-indexes.
- **Git worktree support**: when `.git` is a worktree marker file (not a
  directory), the project root is correctly resolved to the worktree itself.
- **Long UNC-path support** on Windows for repositories under `\\?\C:\…` paths.
- **Repository groups** for cross-repo search across user-defined sets of
  projects (e.g. all related microservice repos).

### Changed

- **Search quality**: re-tuned RRF fusion of the vector / BM25 / exact-identifier
  signals so common tool names and exact strings are no longer drowned out by
  semantic neighbours, reducing the rate at which agents fall back to external
  grep.
- **Idle eviction**: only refreshes a project's "last accessed" timestamp on a
  direct query against that project, not on fan-out queries that touch the
  index merely because they routed through the same group.
- **TUI CPU%**: now normalised by core count.

### Fixed

- **Security**: validate `CODESEARCH_CONFIG` environment variable against a path
  traversal pattern (CodeQL finding). Config path is now rejected if it contains
  `..` segments, preventing a directory traversal via env var.
- **Issue #30** ([LMDB resize crash on large repositories](https://github.com/flupkede/codesearch/issues/30)):
  When the database grew beyond its initial allocation (`MDB_MAP_FULL`), the
  resize failed with `"an environment is already opened with different options"`.
  The fix closes and reopens the LMDB environment around the resize, allowing
  codesearch to index large repositories (tested: 4400+ files, 89 MB) without
  crashing.
- File-change tracking and reaper visibility in `serve` mode.

### Removed

- Server-side transparent MCP session-reconnect middleware: replaced by the
  client-side retry in the stdio proxy. The middleware could not reach
  non-compliant remote MCP clients (their HTTP pool gives up at the TCP layer
  before the request hits the server) and added a session-counter leak.

### Known limitations

- Remote MCP clients that do not handle 404 "Session not found" per the MCP
  spec (e.g. OpenCode 1.14.x at the time of writing) need to be restarted after
  a `codesearch serve` restart.
- `codesearch serve` keeps one writer per database (LMDB invariant). Concurrent
  reindex from a second process is rejected.
